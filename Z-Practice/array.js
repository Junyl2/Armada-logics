//While arrays help with lists, objects provide a way to model and structure information about entities. Letâ€™s dive into how they work!

//Objects can store various data types, including numbers, strings, arrays, and even functions (methods).
//You can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation Bracket notation is particularly useful when property names contain special characters or are dynamic..

//Objects are mutable, meaning you can add, update, or remove properties after creation.
